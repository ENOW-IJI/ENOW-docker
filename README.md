In the latest version, the class packages have been changed from "backtype.storm" to "org.apache.storm" and Storm can not properly support Apache-Kafka-0.10.0.0 or higher version of Kafka.

These are the new features you should expect in the coming
months:



* [x] Support "org.apache.storm" class packages instead of "backtype.storm"
* [ ] Support Kafka Broker with Storm-Kafka(0.9.0.1) for Kafka Integration.
* [ ] Support Trident Topology for powerful batch processing.
* [ ] Including zkServer starter.
* [ ] Handling JavaScript on Java 1.8.
* [ ] Using Apache Kafka, connect other services, devices and server via mqtt and http.
* [ ] Deploy ENOW with Docker.
